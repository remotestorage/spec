                            remotestorage

Abstract

    This draft describes a protocol by which client-side applications,
    running inside a web browser, can communicate with a data storage
    server that is hosted on a different domain name. This way, the 
    provider of a web application need not also play the role of data 
    storage provider. The protocol supports storing, retrieving, and
    removing individual documents, as well as listing the contents of an
    individual directory, and access control is based on bearer tokens.

1.  Introduction

    Many services for data storage are available over the internet. This
    specification describes a vendor-independent interface for such
    services. It is based on https, CORS and bearer tokens. The
    metaphor for addressing data on the storage is that of folders
    containing documents and subfolders. The actions the interface
    exposes are:

       *  GET a folder: retrieve the names and current versions of the
          documents and subfolders currently contained by the folder

       *  GET a document: retrieve its content type, current version,
          and contents

       *  PUT a document: store a new version, its content type, and
          contents, conditional on the current version

       *  DELETE a document: remove it from the storage, conditional on
          the current version

    The exact details of these four actions are described in this
    specification.

2. Terminology

    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
    "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this


de Jong                                                         [Page 2]

    document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [WORDS].

    "SHOULD" and "SHOULD NOT" are appropriate when valid exceptions to a
    general requirement are known to exist or appear to exist, and it is
    infeasible or impractical to enumerate all of them.  However, they
    should not be interpreted as permitting implementors to fail to
    implement the general requirement when such failure would result in
    interoperability failure.

3. Storage model

    The server stores data in nodes that form a tree structure.
    Internal nodes are called 'folders' and leaf nodes are called
    'documents'. For a folder, the server stores references to nodes
    contained in the folder, and it should be able to produce a list of
    them, with for each contained item:

       * item name
       * item type (folder or document)
       * current version

    For a document, the server stores, and should be able to produce:

       * content type
       * content
       * current version

4. Requests

    Client-to-server requests SHOULD be made over https [HTTPS]. The 
    root folder of the storage tree is represented by the URL
    <storage_root> '/'. Subsequently, if <parent_folder> is the URL of a
    folder, then the URL of an item contained in it is
    <parent_folder> <document_name> for a document, or
    <parent_folder> <folder_name> '/' for a folder. Item names MAY
    contain a-z, A-Z, 0-9, %,  -, _.

    A successful GET request to a folder SHOULD be responded to with a
    JSON document (content type 'application/json'), representing a map
    in which contained documents appear as entries <item_name> to
    <current_version>, and contained folders appear as entries
    <item_name> '/' to <current_version>, for instance:
     
       {
         "abc": 1234567890123,
         "def/": 1234567890456
       }
      
    Empty folders are treated as non-existing, and therefore GET
    requests to them SHOULD be responded to with a 404 response, and an


de Jong                                                         [Page 3]
 
Internet-Draft              remotestorage                  December 2012


    empty folder MUST NOT be listed as an item in its parent folder.
    Also, folders SHOULD be created silently, as necessary to contain
    newly added items. This way, PUT and DELETE requests only need to be
    made to documents, and folder management becomes an implicit result.

    A successful GET request to a document SHOULD be responded to with
    the full document contents in the body, the document's content type
    in a 'Content-Type' header, and the document's current version in an
    'ETag' header.


    A successful PUT request to a document MUST result in:
       
       * the request body being stored as the document's new content,
       * parent and further ancestor folders being silently created as
         necessary, with the document (name and version) being added to
         its parent folder, and each folder added to its subsequent
         parent,
       * the value of its Content-Type header being stored as the
         document's new content type,
       * the current server time, in the form of milliseconds since
         0:00 UCT, 1 January, 1970 being stored as the new version of
         the document itself, as well as of its parent folder and
         further ancestor folders.
      
    The response MUST contain an ETag header, with the document's new
    version (milliseconds since the beginning of 1970) as its value.

    A successful DELETE request to a document MUST result in the
    deletion of that document from the storage, and from its parent
    folder. If the parent folder is left empty by this, then it MUST
    also be removed, and so on for ancestor folders.

    A successful OPTIONS request SHOULD be responded to as described in
    the CORS section below.

5. Response codes

    The following responses SHOULD be given in the indicated cases, in
    order of preference, and SHOULD be recognized by the client:
       
       * 500 if an internal server error occurs,
       * 420 if the client makes too frequent requests or is suspected
             of malicious activity,
       * 400 for all malformed requests (e.g. foreign characters in the
             path or unrecognized http verb, etcetera), as well as for
             all PUT and DELETE requests to folders,
       * 401 for all requests that don't have a bearer token with
             sufficient permissions,
       * 404 for all DELETE and GET requests to nodes that do not exist


de Jong                                                         [Page 4]
 
Internet-Draft              remotestorage                  December 2012

      
             on the storage,
       * 304 for a conditional GET request whose condition fails
             (see "Versioning" below),
       * 409 for a conditional PUT or DELETE request whose condition
             fails (see "Versioning" below),
       * 200 for all successful requests, including PUT and DELETE,
   
    Clients SHOULD also handle the case where a response takes too long
    to arrive, or where no response is received at all.

6. Versioning

    The current version of a document is the 13-digit decimal number
    representing the number of milliseconds between 00:00 UCT, 1 January
    1970, and the last time its content or content type were set or
    changed successfully. The current version of a folder is the highest
    version of any of the items it contains.

    All successful requests MUST return an 'ETag' header with, in the 
    case of GET, the current version, in the case of PUT, the new 
    version, and in case of DELETE, the version that was deleted. PUT 
    and DELETE requests MAY have an 'If-Unmodified-Since' request
    header, and MUST fail with a 409 response code if that doesn't match 
    the document's current version. GET requests MAY have an
    'If-Modified-Since' header, and SHOULD be responded to with a 304 if
    that matches the document or folder's current version.

7. CORS headers

    All responses MUST carry CORS headers [CORS]. The server MUST also
    reply to OPTIONS requests as per CORS. For GET requests, a wildcard
    origin MAY be returned, but for PUT and DELETE requests, the
    response MUST echo back the Origin header sent by the client.

8. Session description

    The information that a client needs to receive in order to be able
    to connect to a server SHOULD reach the client as described in the 
    'bearer token issuance' sections below. It consists of:
    
       * <storage_root>, consisting of 'https://' followed by a server
         host, and optionally a server port and a path prefix as per
         [IRI]. Examples:
         * 'https://example.com' (host only)
         * 'https://example.com:8080' (host and port)
         * 'https://example.com/some?path/to/storage' (host, port and
           path prefix; note there is no trailing slash)
       * <access_token> as per [OAUTH]. The token SHOULD be hard to 
         guess and SHOULD NOT be reused from one client to another. It  
         can however be reused in subsequent interactions with the same 


de Jong                                                         [Page 5]
 
Internet-Draft              remotestorage                  December 2012


         client, as long as that client is still trusted. Example:
         * 'ofb24f1ac3973e70j6vts19qr9v2eei'
       * <storage_api>, always 'draft-dejong-remotestorage-00' for this
         version of the specification.

    The client can make its requests using https with CORS and bearer
    tokens, to the URL that is the concatenation of <storage_root> with
    '/' plus one or more <folder> '/' strings indicating a path in the
    folder tree, followed by zero or one <document> strings, indicating
    a document. For example, if <storage_root> is
    "https://storage.example.com/bob", then to retrieve the folder
    contents of the /public/documents/ folder, or to retrieve a
    'draft.txt' document from that folder, the client would make 
    requests to, respectively:
      
    * https://storage.example.com/bob/public/documents/
    * https://storage.example.com/bob/public/documents/draft.txt

9. Bearer tokens and access control

    A bearer token represents one or more access scopes. These access
    scopes are represented as strings of the form <module> <level>,
    where the <module> string SHOULD be lower-case alphanumerical, other
    than the reserved word 'public', and <level> can be ':r' or ':rw'.
    The access the bearer token gives is the sum of its access scopes,
    with each access scope representing the following permissions:
      
    'root:rw') any request,
             
    'root:r') any GET request,

    <module> ':rw') any requests to paths that start with
                    '/' <module> '/' or '/public/' <module> '/',

    <module> ':r') any GET requests to paths that start with
                   '/' <module> '/' or '/public/' <module> '/',
      
    As a special exceptions, GET requests to a document (but not a
    folder) whose path starts with '/public/' are always allowed. They,
    as well as OPTIONS requests, can be made without a bearer token. All
    other requests should present a bearer token with sufficient access
    scope, using a header of the following form:
      
       Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
          
10. Application-first bearer token issuance

    To make a remotestorage server available as 'the remotestorage of
    <user> at <host>', exactly one link of the following format SHOULD 
    be added to the webfinger record [WEBFINGER] of <user> at <host>:


de Jong                                                         [Page 6]
 
Internet-Draft              remotestorage                  December 2012


    {
      href: <storage_root>,
      rel: "remotestorage",
      type: <storage_api>,
      properties: {
        'auth-method': "http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.2",
        'auth-endpoint': <auth_endpoint>
      }
    }    

    Here <storage_root> and <storage_api> are as per "Session
    description" above, and <auth_endpoint> SHOULD be a URL where an
    OAuth2 implicit-grant flow dialog [OAUTH] is be presented, so the
    user can supply her credentials (how, is out of scope), and allow or  
    reject a request by the connecting application to obtain a bearer
    token for a certain list of access scopes.
      
    The server SHOULD NOT expire bearer tokens unless they are revoked,
    and MAY require the user to register applications as OAuth clients
    before first use; if no client registration is required, then the
    server MAY ignore the client_id parameter in favour of relying on
    the redirect_uri parameter for client identification.
      
11. Storage-first bearer token issuance

    The provider MAY also present a dashboard to the user, where she
    has some way to add open web app manifests [MANIFEST]. Adding a 
    manifest to the dashboard is considered equivalent to clicking 
    'accept' in the dialog of the application-first flow. Removing one 
    is considered equivalent to revoking its access token.

    As an equivalent to OAuth's 'scope' parameter, a 'remotestorage'
    field SHOULD be present in the root of such an application manifest
    document, as a JSON array of strings, each string being one access
    scope of the form <module> <level>.
    
    When the user gestures she wants to use a certain application whose
    manifest is present on the dashboard, the dashboard SHOULD redirect
    to the application or open it in a new window. To mimic coming back 
    from the OAuth dialog, it MAY add 'access_token' and 'scope' 
    parameters to the URL fragment.

    Regardless of whether 'access_token' and 'scope' are specified, it
    SHOULD add a 'remotestorage' parameter to the URL fragment, with a
    value of the form <user> '@' <host>. When the application detects 
    this parameter, it SHOULD resolve the webfinger record for <user> at
    <host> and extract the <storage_root> and <storage_api> information.
      
    If no access_token was given, then the application SHOULD also
    extract the <auth_endpoint> information from webfinger, and continue


de Jong                                                         [Page 7]

Internet-Draft              remotestorage                  December 2012


    as per application-first bearer token issuance.
    
    Note that whereas a remotestorage server SHOULD offer support of the
    application-first flow with webfinger and OAuth, it MAY choose not
    to support the storage-first flow, provided that users will easily 
    remember their <user> '@' <host> webfinger address at that provider.
    Applications SHOULD, however, support both flows, which means  
    checking the URL for a 'remotestorage' parameter, but giving the
    user a way to specify her webfinger address if there is none.

    If a server provides an application manifest dashboard, then it
    SHOULD merge the list of applications there with the list of
    issued access tokens as specified by OAuth into one list. Also, 
    the interface for revoking an access token as specified by OAuth  
    SHOULD coincide with removing an application from the dashboard.

12. Security Considerations
      
    To prevent man-in-the-middle attacks, the use of https instead of 
    http is important for both the interface itself and all end-points 
    involved in webfinger, OAuth, and (if present) the storage-first 
    application launch dashboard. 

    A malicious party could link to an application, but specifying a
    remotestorage user address that it controls, thus tricking the user
    into using a trusted application to send sensitive data to the wrong
    remotestorage server. To mitigate this, applications SHOULD clearly
    display to which remotestorage server they are sending the user's
    data.
    
    Applications could request scopes that the user did not intend to
    give access to. The user SHOULD always be prompted to carefully
    review which scopes an application is requesting.
    
    An application may upload malicious html pages and then trick the
    user into visiting them, or upload malicious client-side scripts,
    that take advantage of being hosted on the user's domain name. The
    origin on which the remotestorage server has its interface SHOULD
    therefore NOT be used for anything else, and the user SHOULD be 
    warned not to visit any web pages on that origin. In particular, the 
    OAuth dialog and launch dashboard or token revokation interface 
    SHOULD be on a different origin than the remotestorage interface.
      
    Where the use of bearer tokens is impractical, a user may choose to
    store documents on hard-to-guess URLs whose path after
    <storage_root> starts with '/public/', while sharing this URL only
    with the intended audience. That way, only parties who know the
    document's hard-to-guess URL, can access it. The server SHOULD
    therefore make an effort to detect and stop brute-force attacks that
    attempt to guess the location of such documents.

    The server SHOULD also detect and stop denial-of-service attacks
    that aim to overwhelm its interface with too much traffic.
