# remoteStorage Spec

This repository is where we manage and keep track of updates to the
remoteStorage protocol specification, currently published as Internet-Draft
(I-D):

    https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-dejong-remotestorage/

A simple introduction and summary of how the protocol works can be found on
[remotestorage.io](https://remotestorage.io/protocol).
